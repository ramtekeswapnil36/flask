# Seminar Hall Booking

### **Tasks before Live Coding Round**

1. Install and setup everything. Make sure you are able to run and test the application.
2. Go through the code and try to understand different aspects of the application.
3. Make notes of the doubts or problems you faced if any.

### About

The project is a Rest API application with **6** seminar halls - 

| Hall Name | Capacity |
| --------- | -------- |
| A         | 50       |
| B         | 100      |
| C         | 200      |
| D         | 350      |
| E         | 500      |
| F         | 1000     |

A starter code of the application is provided for you. The application is built using **python**, **flask**, and **SQLite database**. Don't worry if you have not worked with **flask** or **SQLite database**, you just have to complete a function using **core python**.

### Installation and Running

1. Install the packages in file `requirements.txt`. **You must create a virtual environment and setup the packages**.
2. Run `start.py` to start the application.
3. Run `test/test_api.py` to check if application is started properly. We have pre-populated the database with some bookings. And `test/test_api.py` lists all the bookings in the `BOOKING` table. You must analyse and understand the returned records.
